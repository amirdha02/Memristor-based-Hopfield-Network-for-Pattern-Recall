# Memristor-Based Hopfield Network for Pattern Recall

This project implements a Hopfield neural network using memristor-inspired Hebbian learning rules to explore robust pattern recall. The focus lies in understanding how non-volatile memory-like weight persistence can enhance recall stability when inputs are corrupted or incomplete.

This model conceptually mirrors the behavior of **memristive NVM elements** and simulates pattern association under analog constraints.

## üß™ Relevance to NVM Characterization

This project demonstrates key behaviors relevant to non-volatile memory systems:
- **Weight stability** under input fluctuation
- **Analog-inspired update logic**
- **Associative recall robustness** tied to memory persistence

These concepts parallel how embedded memory arrays in microcontroller systems must operate under noisy conditions and degraded signal states‚Äîparticularly relevant for Smart Power systems in automotive environments.
